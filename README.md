This is a skeleton project for using Babel and React with tup as the build
tool. It's how projects like [sightreading.training][] are built.

# Getting started

Run these commands:

```
git clone
npm install
tup init
tup monitor -a
```

Open `index.html` in your browser. As you make changes files will
automatically be rebuilt.
